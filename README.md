# SQL-ArtProject-Analysis


### In this Project, I will be exploring a 7 table dataset to answer questions about the data and gain insights that may be valauable to artists, museums, and consumers of art content.


### Museum-Info File:
In this file, I explore different metrics related to the museumâ€™s hours and availability. Being that I am US-based, I examined the distribution of museum access across different states, detailing their opening times and identifying information. Additionally, I explored the hours and days of operation for museums internationally. This analysis could be valuable to both consumers and museum owners because it provides insights that can be used to adjust their operational hours and days to better meet the needs of visitors.
