# SQL-ArtProject-Analysis


#### In this Project, I will be exploring a 7-table dataset to answer questions about the data and gain insights that may be valuable to artists, museums, and consumers of art content.


## Museum-Info File:
In this file, I explore different metrics related to the museumâ€™s hours and availability. Being that I am US-based, I examined the distribution of museum access across different states, detailing their opening times and identifying information. Additionally, I explored the hours and days of operation for museums internationally. This analysis could be valuable to both consumers and museum owners because it provides insights that can be used to adjust their operational hours and days to better meet the needs of visitors.


## Artist-Exploration File:
In this file, I explore metrics pertaining to the individual artist. This includes specific artist information, art style popularity analysis, artist popularity analysis, and the geographic distribution of popularity. Exploring these metrics would be valuable to artists and art consumers because it reveals cultural and market trend insights. Both artists and consumers could use this information to market themselves better to their intended audience.


## Sales-Exploration File:
In this project, I explore various metrics related to art sales and artist performance. I started by adding a column named `price_markup` to capture the amount added to the sale price. Next, I identified the painting with the highest price markup. Additionally, I analyzed the number of art pieces originating from each country and compared regular prices to sale prices. I also determined which artist has made the most wealth from art sales and which artist makes the most wealth per piece of art. Furthermore, I examined the total wealth, average wealth, and the number of art pieces categorized by art subject. Finally, I identified the most expensive and least expensive pieces of art. This analysis provides valuable insights into the art market, benefiting collectors, sellers, and enthusiasts by highlighting trends and performance metrics within the industry.


#### Assumptions About The Data: 
Sale_price represents the origal price of the art when it was listed to be sold.<br/>
Regular_price represents the price that the art was actually sold at.
