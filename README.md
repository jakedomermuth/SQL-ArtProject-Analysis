# SQL-ArtProject-Analysis


### In this Project, I will be exploring a 7-table dataset to answer questions about the data and gain insights that may be valuable to artists, museums, and consumers of art content.


### Museum-Info File:
In this file, I explore different metrics related to the museumâ€™s hours and availability. Being that I am US-based, I examined the distribution of museum access across different states, detailing their opening times and identifying information. Additionally, I explored the hours and days of operation for museums internationally. This analysis could be valuable to both consumers and museum owners because it provides insights that can be used to adjust their operational hours and days to better meet the needs of visitors.


### Artist-Exploration File:
This project is still in progress. 


### Sales-Exploration File:
This part is still in progress


## Assumptions about the Data: 
Work_id has multiple values which represent multiple copies of the same artwork.
sale_price represents the origal price of the art when it was listed to be sold.
regular_price represents the price that the art was actually sold at.
